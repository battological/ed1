	<h2><a id='what-is-ed'>What is an edit distance?</a></h2>
	<p>Edit distance is a measure of similarity between two words. An edit may be an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a letter. We use the most common metric, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance'>Levenshtein distance</a>.

	<h2><a id='why-no-words'>No similar words</a></h2>
	<p>There may be no similar words for two reasons:</p>
	<h3>Word is not similar to other words</h3>
	<p>We have seen your word before, but have found no other words with an edit distance of one from your word.</p>
	<h3>Word is not known</h3>
	<p>We use a small subset of English words based on the standard Unix words file. Specifically, we use those words in the american-english list that are not capitalized and that include no punctuation. This covers most common words, but far from every word in English. If your word is not in that list, we simply don't know about it.</p>

	<h2><a id='code'>Source code</a></h2>
	<p>This is not a fancy project, and all the files are already available to you through view source in your browser. However, the code and data is also <a href='https://github.com/battological/ed1'>hosted on Github</a>.</p>

	<h2><a id='contact'>Contact</a></h2>
	<p>For questions, please open an issue on the project's <a href='https://github.com/battological/ed1'>Github repository</a></p>
